Do you want me to do that?






You said:
whats the readme? Text?


ChatGPT said:
Yes — exactly! A README.md is just a text file (written in Markdown) that explains your project. It’s not code that runs—it’s like a guide or instruction manual for anyone visiting your GitHub repository.

On GitHub Pages, the README text appears right below your live website link, so people can see:

What the project is

How to use it

How it’s organized

Any special instructions or controls

It usually uses Markdown syntax (like # for headings, - for lists, ``` for code blocks) so it looks nice on GitHub.

So the README I just made for your ziggurat project is pure text, but formatted so GitHub Pages and GitHub display it nicely.

If you want, I can explain exactly how to add it to your GitHub repo so it shows up correctly on your project page. Do you want me to do that?
